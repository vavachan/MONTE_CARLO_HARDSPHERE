# MONTE_CARLO_HARDSPHERE
This is an monte carlo simulation of hard-sphere simulation written with the intention of studying hard-sphere nucleation. This program uses bond-order parameter to differentiate between solid and liquid particles. It also finds the different solid clusters in the system. Umbrella Sampling is used to find the free energy barrier for crystal nucleation.The code used boost libraries to calculate the spherical harmonics. The libraries has to be manually included in the bop.cpp file. 
To compile : make
